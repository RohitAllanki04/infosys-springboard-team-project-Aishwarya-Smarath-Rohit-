Frontend: Consolidate navbars, remove duplication, prepare for backend integration

What changed:
- Consolidated `adminNavbar.jsx` and `userNavbar.jsx` logic into a single `Navbar.jsx` component that accepts a `role` prop and renders role-specific navigation links.
- Updated `AuthLayout.jsx` to render the consolidated `Navbar` with the resolved role instead of rendering separate navbar components.
- Kept `adminNavbar.jsx` and `userNavbar.jsx` as small re-export shims pointing to `Navbar.jsx` for backward compatibility (marked deprecated). This avoids breaking imports while removing duplicate implementation.
- No UI/behavior changes intended; this is a refactor to remove duplication and simplify future maintenance and API integration.

Why:
- Reduces duplicated code and makes it easier to add API integrations and role-based behavior in one place.
- Keeps the frontend self-contained and ready to integrate with the backend APIs you will build.

Next steps (optional):
- Remove the shim files (`adminNavbar.jsx`/`userNavbar.jsx`) entirely once all references are confirmed removed.
- Run the app and verify navigation for different roles. Update `utils/roles.js` if you want consistent role comparisons (there is a minor mismatch in casing logic currently).
- Connect `Navbar` links to real backend endpoints and verify authenticated flows.
